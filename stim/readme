This stim directory constains the stimulus files for the design. Also included
is the modified ffmpeg program to create this stimulus. Download the ffmpeg source. Replace the h264.c with this one and compile it. Simply do a normal
decode and bitsream.dat and levels.dat will be created in the current directory. It is probably best to redirect the output since I littered it with printfs in 
order to figure out how it works and have not removed them. Example, decode 1 second of Video.mp4

./ffmpeg -t 1 -i Video.mp4 -vcodec rawvideo output.avi > log

The first word in the bistream is the bit offset that the stream starts at. The test bench
will parse this data and apply the data shifted appropriately to the dut. After the first
word will be the raw bitstream data, 16 bits per line.

The levels file contains the output levels as a signed integer seperate by a space. The test
bench will parse this file and compare the output of the dut to these values.

Here are the files generate thus far:

bistream0.dat : bistream file extracted from ffmpeg.  
                The source video was from 
                http://www.elecard.com/download/clips.php 
                it is the BMP2 video at 320x240. 
levels0.dat   : level data extracted from this video during the decode process.
                This contains 1000 level entries.
